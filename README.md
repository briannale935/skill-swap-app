## Core Features

### 1. User Registration, Login & Profile Management

- Users register and log in using Firebase Authentication, ensuring secure access.
- Profiles include key details such as name, skill(s) they can teach, skill(s) they want to learn, location, time availability, years of experience, and email.
- Users can easily edit and update their profiles to reflect new interests and schedule changes.

### 2. Skill Matching & Request System

- A smart matching system connects users based on the skill they wish to learn and the skill they can teach.
- Users can browse through potential matches and send an invite to initiate a skill swap.
- Once both users accept the request, contact details are revealed, allowing them to coordinate learning sessions.
- This mutual exchange eliminates financial barriers and promotes diverse learning opportunities.

### 3. Matches Tab

- **Pending Matches:** Displays users who have requested to swap skills with you but are awaiting your response.
- **Accepted Matches:** Shows users with whom you’ve successfully completed a skill swap.
- Users can accept or reject invites directly within the interface, ensuring an intuitive and seamless user experience.

### 4. Reviews & Ratings

- After successfully completing a skill swap, users can review and rate their learning experience.
- Reviews include:
  - The matched user’s name
  - A short written message describing the experience
  - A rating on a scale of 1-5
- This feature fosters a trust-based environment, ensuring quality exchanges and improving user credibility over time.

### 5. Blog & Discussion Threads

- Users can create blog posts by selecting a topic, adding relevant tags, and writing a detailed description.
- The blog serves as a discussion forum where users can engage in meaningful conversations.
- Other users can comment, ask questions, and contribute to ongoing discussions, making it a space for continuous knowledge sharing beyond direct skill swaps.
- Future improvements will focus on making the blog more descriptive to facilitate better engagement.
